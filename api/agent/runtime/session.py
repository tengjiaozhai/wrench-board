    `tier` picks which agent (fast=Haiku, normal=Sonnet, deep=Opus) handles the
    conversation. A new WS connection with a different tier = a fresh MA session
    on that tier's agent. No in-session swap: by design, tier choice is explicit
    and the user starts a new conversation when changing it.

    MA persists the full event stream server-side, so the happy-path replay
    on resume pulls from `client.beta.sessions.events.list(sid)` rather than
    from the local JSONL. The JSONL under `memory/{slug}/repairs/{repair_id}/
    conversations/{conv}/messages.jsonl` is still written live as an on-disk
    mirror — used for UI re-rendering on reconnect when MA's event stream is
    inaccessible (checkpoint expired after 30 d idle, Anthropic outage, etc.).
    That mirror is the reason JSONL keeps being written — the technician's
    repair history (chat bubbles in the UI) survives even if the managed
    session is gone. Semantic context for the agent now comes from the
    per-repair scribe mount instead of an LLM-summarized recap.

    `owner_ref` (the tenant id from the cloud's X-Owner-Ref header) binds the
