"""Cousin-fallback hint for the diagnostic agent (T9a Phase B).

When the current board has no schematic of its own, the agent can still lean on a
sibling pack (same device family, a nearby board revision) as an INDICATIVE
reference — similar power rails and topology. This builds the one-line hint
injected into the system prompt; the caller gates it on "no graph for this board".

Best-effort: any registry/filesystem hiccup returns None — a missing hint must
never disturb a session. The sibling boards stay DISTINCT (suggestion, never a
merge): the line tells the agent to cross-check, not to trust blindly."""
