"""Fallback diagnostic runtime using `messages.stream` (no Managed Agents).

Keeps the WebSocket protocol identical to `runtime_managed`, so the frontend
doesn't care which mode is active. Activated with env var
`DIAGNOSTIC_MODE=direct`; used when the Managed Agents beta is unavailable
or when a lighter-weight path is wanted for local development.

Uses the streaming Messages API so each completed text block is emitted to
the WebSocket as soon as it finishes, rather than waiting for the full
response.

    When `repair_id` is provided, the session is scoped to that repair:
    past messages are loaded from disk and replayed to the client, and
    every new turn is appended to the same JSONL. Without it, the session
    runs unpersisted and exits when the WS closes.

    `owner_ref` (the tenant id from the cloud's X-Owner-Ref header) binds the
    session to its tenant so owner-sensitive tools (stock) stay isolated.

    `can_expand` (the cloud's X-Wb-Can-Expand verdict) gates the paid pack
    enrichment tool: False (free plan) drops `mb_expand_knowledge` from the
    manifest so the agent never proposes it. True / self-host = unrestricted.
