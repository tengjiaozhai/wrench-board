    # --- Managed Agents stream watchdog ---------------------------------------
    # Inactivity timeout on `client.beta.sessions.events.stream(...)`. The
    # async iterator can block indefinitely if Anthropic's SSE stalls without
    # closing the TCP connection (TCP keepalive ~9 min by default). The
    # watchdog timeouts the stream and emits a `stream_timeout` WS event so
    # the frontend can surface "session lost — please reconnect" instead of
    # showing an infinite spinner. 600 s (10 min) is generous: Opus + adaptive
    # thinking on a complex turn can spend 1-2 min before its first event.

    # --- Managed Agents teardown / async safety -------------------------------
    # On WS close we cancel the recv/emit forwarder pair and wait briefly for
    # each task to unwind so tearing down emitters does not race with an
    # in-flight write. Per-task budget (vs a global gather) prevents one slow
    # task from starving the other; the warning logged on overrun maps "did
    # not unwind" to recv vs emit by task name. Override only when a forwarder
    # is observed routinely overflowing the default and the noise becomes a
    # post-mortem hazard.

    # --- Managed Agents sub-agent consultations -------------------------------
    # The MA runtime can spawn ephemeral sub-agents on demand: a tier-scoped
    # consultant (one-shot Q&A on another tier) and the bootstrapped
    # KnowledgeCurator (focused web research). Each runs in its own MA session
    # and is bounded by a wait_for so a stalled SSE doesn't block the parent
    # turn forever. Defaults sized for an Opus turn on the parent (consultant
    # ≈ 2 min, curator ≈ 3 min including web_search round-trips).

    # --- Managed Agents camera / capture flow ---------------------------------
    # Flow B (camera capture): the agent issues a capture_request to the
    # frontend over WS and waits for the macro frame. If the tech has no
    # camera selected or the browser stalls, we time out and return an
    # is_error custom_tool_result so the agent can recover. Mirrors the
    # default copy in `_dispatch_cam_capture`'s timeout error message.

    # --- Managed Agents protocol confirmation -------------------------------
    # `bv_propose_protocol` is gated by an explicit tech accept/reject before
    # the protocol is materialised on disk and pushed to the UI panel. The
    # runtime emits `protocol_pending_confirmation`, parks on a Future, and
    # bounds the wait so a tech who walks away or closes the tab doesn't
    # leave the MA session stuck on `requires_action` forever — the timeout
    # path posts an is_error custom_tool_result so the agent can recover.

    # --- Managed Agents memory_stores HTTP fallback ---------------------------
    # Raw HTTP fallback path (used when the SDK does not expose
    # `client.beta.memory_stores`). The Anthropic memory_stores REST endpoints
    # respond fast in the happy path; the timeout exists to bound a network
    # stall so the diagnostic session can degrade to "no memory" instead of
    # blocking the WS handshake. Override if a slow proxy is in front of the
    # API.
