"""Targeted pack expansion — grow an existing device's memory bank in place.

When the diagnostic agent calls `mb_get_rules_for_symptoms` and comes back
empty-handed, it can call `mb_expand_knowledge(focus_symptoms, focus_refdes)`
to trigger THIS pipeline. We don't rebuild the whole pack; we:

1. Append a targeted Scout run to the existing `raw_research_dump.md`
   (cumulative — the dump grows with every expansion).
2. Re-run the Registry Builder on the enriched dump to absorb any new
   components/signals the Scout surfaced.
3. Re-run the Clinicien on the enriched dump + merged registry to produce
   an updated rule set focused on the new symptom area.
4. Persist — registry.json and rules.json get overwritten with the merged
   result. Any new canonical names and rule_ids are counted for telemetry.

Cost per expansion: ~$0.40 (Scout Sonnet + Registry Sonnet + Clinicien Opus)
vs ~$1.5 for a full rebuild. Cartographe/Lexicographe/Auditor are skipped —
the graph can drift slightly between expansions and the full audit waits
for the next rebuild. Acceptable trade-off for the "living memory bank" UX.

Search plan for this expansion:
- 4–8 searches total, each scoped to one focus symptom + the device.
- Probe the specialized microsoldering families first (r/boardrepair, Rossmann,
  NorthridgeFix, iPadRehab, badcaps, EEVblog). These are where component-level
  audio / RF / charging threads live in detail.
- For each focus refdes if any, search the refdes + device together
  (e.g. "iPhone X U3101 no sound", "iPhone X Meson audio codec").
- Do NOT re-cover power-rail / boot / charge topics already in the pack —
  we already have those; new material only.

Stop when you have 3–6 concrete symptom bullets with traceable sources.
