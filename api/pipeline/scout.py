"""Phase 1 — Scout. Autonomous web research using the native Claude web_search tool.

Output: a single Markdown document (the "raw research dump"). No JSON, no structured form.

The Scout runs once; if the produced dump falls below the configured thresholds
(min symptoms / components / sources) the orchestrator re-invokes it with a
broader-search suffix. After `max_retries` failures we raise `ThinScoutDumpError`
so the pipeline stops instead of paying for downstream phases on a bankrupt dump.
