"""Deterministic existence ground-truth over the compiled electrical graph.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
On real builds the pack pipeline (Scout → Registry → Writers → Auditor
revise-loop) fails to converge. The web-derived Registry covers only ~2 % of
a board's identifiers, so the LLM Auditor flags REAL schematic identifiers as
"fabricated" — e.g. switch `SWV011`, or the `PP1V2_S2` rail at 1.2 V sourced by
`U8100`. Those are genuine, they just never made it into the thin web glossary.

The fix is to make `electrical_graph.json` queryable as the EXISTENCE ground
truth: "does U8100 exist?", "what powers PP1V2_S2?", "at what voltage?". Every
answer is a deterministic lookup against the compiled graph — no LLM, no guess.

CRITICAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT — QUERIES, NOT DUMPS
-----------------------------------------------
This module NEVER dumps the graph into a generative context. The 2026-04-24
lesson (see the Phase 1 comment in api/pipeline/orchestrator.py): when Scout was
handed the graph as context, a URL-by-URL audit found **23/23 fabricated refdes
attributions** — the model confidently invented connectivity that "fit". So the
only surfaces here are:
  * deterministic boolean / list lookups (GraphTruth),
  * a COMPILED, mention-scoped report that lists ONLY identifiers already named
    by the writers (build_ground_truth_report — never unmentioned graph content),
  * a single targeted query tool the model must call to verify a claim
    (QUERY_GRAPH_TOOL / handle_query_graph),
  * a deterministic registry-signal enrichment (enrich_registry_from_graph).

Downstream tasks (not in this module) wire these into drift / auditor / revisers.
