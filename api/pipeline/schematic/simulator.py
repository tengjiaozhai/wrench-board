"""Behavioral event-driven simulator over the compiled ElectricalGraph.

Sync, pure, deterministic. Progresses a board state phase-by-phase using the
Opus-refined boot sequence when present (graph_analyzed phases with triggers
carrying `from_refdes`), else the compiler's topological boot_sequence.

No SPICE, no analog modelling - rail/component/signal states are closed
enums. The output is a list of discrete `BoardState` snapshots the UI can
scrub through and the agent can reason about ("kill U12 -> blocked at Phi2").

             post-failure-application state is already 'dead' (shorted ICs
             marking their own rails, open-mode passive kills, regulating_low
             UVLO consequences propagated by `_activate_components`). This
             unions the by-construction kills with the cause-driven kills so
             cascade aggregates reflect the full failure surface.
          2. `dead_components` = `effective_dead` plus every component whose
             `power_in` pin sits on a rail whose original source is in
             `effective_dead`.
          3. `dead_rails` = every rail whose source is dead after step 2,
             plus every final-state rail that is `shorted` or that is
             `degraded` with a voltage below TOLERANCE_UVLO (its consumers
             cannot power on, so for cascade purposes the rail itself is dead).
          4. `dead_components` is then extended to include consumers of the
             dead rails — closes the "if a rail is dead its consumers are too"
             invariant in a single linear pass.

        Downstream callers (bridge, tool, endpoint, evaluator) read
        `cascade_dead_*` to decide what's affected; relying only on
        `self.killed` previously hid every cause-driven failure.
