"""Compiler — SchematicGraph → ElectricalGraph.

Derives the final interrogeable artefact:

- `power_rails`   from nets marked `is_power` and their `powers` / `powered_by` /
                  `enables` / `decouples` edges produced by the vision pass
- `depends_on`    edges added globally (component → component) whenever a consumer
                  is powered by a rail whose producer is known
- `boot_sequence` phases built via Kahn topological sort on those deps
- `voltage_nominal` parsed from net labels ('+3V3' → 3.3, '+5V' → 5.0, …)
- `quality`       report — counts of orphan refs, missing values, global confidence

No LLM call. Pure function of its `SchematicGraph` input (plus optional
per-page confidences for the quality report).

#

    PMU ICs route their integrated buck regulator output through an
    external L+C filter and BACK INTO the chip on a self-sense pin
    matching `^V?VDD_BUCK\\d+` (role `power_in`). When the external
    filter inductor lives on the SAME page as the PMU pin list, the
    existing `_promote_ic_owning_switch_node_over_inductor` pass picks
    it up via the inductor bridge. When the inductor is on a separate
    schematic page that wasn't captured (common on Apple's segregated
    "power tree" pages — the regulator IC pin list is on one page,
    the buck output filters on another), the rail stays unsourced
    despite physically being a known IC output.

    This pass closes that gap with four conservative gates:

      1. Rail R is currently unsourced — additive only, never overrides.
      2. R's pin connections include exactly one IC X plus only passives
         (cap / resistor / inductor / ferrite / diode). A buck rail
         shared between a primary and secondary PMU (e.g. iPhone X
         `VDD_BUCK9` connecting both Tigris and the camera PMU) is
         genuinely ambiguous about which side produces vs. consumes,
         so we leave it unsourced.
      3. IC X has at least one `switch_node`-role pin — proves IC X is
         a switching regulator, not a consumer SoC. Without this gate,
         a consumer SoC like Apple A11 (U1000) with `VDD_CPU` /
         `VDD_GPU` `power_in` pins on its rails would be mis-attributed
         as the rails' producer.
      4. IC X's pin connecting to R has role `power_in` AND
         (a) pin.name matches `_BUCK_SELF_SENSE_PIN` — the universal SoC
             PMU buck self-sense convention, OR
         (b) the rail label matches `_BOOST_OUTPUT_RAIL_LABEL` — Apple
             ACORN-style charge-pump / boost-cell convention where the
             cell identifier lives in the rail label (`PP_BOOST1_ACORN`)
             rather than the pin name.

    Pure no-op on schematics that don't use this convention (mnt-reform
    KiCad-style boards, MAX*/LTC* point regulators with `VOUT` / `OUT`
    pin names instead). Empirically verified: zero `VDD_BUCK*` pins and
    zero `PP*_BOOST<n>_*` rails on mnt-reform-motherboard.

    Runs AFTER `_promote_ic_owning_switch_node_over_inductor` so the
    inductor-bridge path is preferred when both paths are available
    (cleaner topology — explicit external filter wins over a self-sense
    fallback). Runs BEFORE `_propagate_sources_through_rail_aliases` so
    any `VDD_BUCK<n>` rail that aliases to a die-side rail (none observed
    today, but conventions evolve) inherits the corrected source.

    """Infer a missing rail source from the lone consumer's other supplies.

    On modern boards a single chip — SoC, baseband, camera-module bus front-end —
    is fed by *one* upstream PMU. The chip pin-list page enumerates 10–15
    die-side `power_in` pins (`VDD_CPU`, `VDDQL_DDR<n>`, `VDDIO18_GRP<n>` …)
    but the LLM rarely captures the producer-side `powers` edge for every
    one of them; the producer is implied by the conventional fanout from the
    same PMU instance. The existing rail-alias propagation
    (`_propagate_sources_through_rail_aliases`) catches die-side rails where
    the LLM did capture an explicit `powers` edge between two rail labels;
    this pass is the consumer-side topology fallback for the rest.

    Heuristic, per unsourced rail R:
      1. R must have exactly ONE consumer C — multi-consumer rails could mix
         domains (e.g. a 1.8 V I/O rail spanning the SoC and a discrete IC may
         not share a PMU).
      2. Gather the family F = sourced rails that C also consumes.
      3. F must be ≥ 3 large (noise filter against accidental 1- or 2-rail
         families, common when only a handful of supplies were captured).
      4. F must agree unanimously on a single source S — any disagreement
         (e.g. two PMUs feeding different banks of the same chip) bails.
      5. S must NOT equal C — a regulator never self-sources, and rules out
         the pathological case where C produces one of its own die-side
         rails (covered separately by the buck-self-sense pass).
      6. S must exist in `graph.components` — defense in depth against an
         upstream pass that left a stale source string. (In practice every
         family entry was source-set by an earlier pass that already
         enforces this invariant; we re-check to keep the pass independent.)

    Side properties preserved:
      - `voltage_nominal` untouched (no I3/I6 risk).
      - `consumers` untouched (no I4 risk; the final scrub still runs).
      - `decoupling` untouched.
      - `enable_net` untouched.

    Cycle (I1) safety: setting source=S on a rail consumed by C only adds
    `depends_on(C, S)` edges. The board-level invariant — PMU never depends
    on chips it powers — already holds in the captured graph (else the
    existing producer-pin / rail-alias passes would have triggered I1). We
    do not introduce a new dependency direction; we only thicken existing
    edges.

    No-op on schematics where every chip already has unanimous source
    coverage (mnt-reform-motherboard) or where families never reach size 3

# partial-match a longer rail name (e.g. `USB_PWR_TIMER` does NOT match

#
# Families covered:

    Boards always have one or more rails fed externally — a barrel jack, a
    USB cable, a battery pack, a power header. Topology-wise the connector
    IS the producer of those rails as far as the on-board graph is
    concerned: no upstream regulator exists *on the board* to claim the
    source. The connector pins for these rails are vision-labelled
    `power_in` (power flowing INTO the pin from the external source),
    which is why `_augment_sources_from_producer_pins` (looking for
    `power_out` / `switch_node`) misses them.

    Three guardrails keep this from misfiring on internal supply rails
    delivered TO peripheral modules through a connector (camera, flash,
    display — common on phone schematics):

      1. **Label gate.** Only rail labels matching `_EXTERNAL_INPUT_RAIL`
         qualify (anchored start+end). Internal-supply rails like
         `PP1V8_CAM_WIDE_VDDIO_CONN` or `PP_STROBE_WARM_WIDE_LED` do not
         match the pattern and are skipped.

      2. **No-producer gate.** If ANY component on the rail (including
         passives like ferrites or inductors) has a `power_out` or
         `switch_node` pin, we skip — that means there's an on-board
         producer (or a passive bridge delivering an upstream rail) and
         the connector is downstream, not source.

      3. **Connector-with-power_in gate.** At least one connector must
         have a `power_in` pin on the rail. Without it there's no
         candidate.

    Picks the lowest refdes deterministically when multiple connectors
    qualify (e.g. multiple USB ports sharing VBUS via the system charger,
    common on multi-port hubs and laptop motherboards).

    Runs LAST in the source-augmentation chain so on-board producers
    (regulators, passive bridges, rail aliases) always win — this is the

    """Merge rails whose underlying is_power nets share a capacitor pin.

    Vision occasionally places the same physical pin on TWO power-net labels
    (the package-side label and the die-side label, e.g. `PP_CPU_PCORE` and
    `VDD_CPU` on iPhone X p4 — pin `C1703.1` is on both). Capacitor terminals
    are electrically isolated (an insulator separates them), so a single cap
    pin can physically belong to ONLY ONE net. When vision says a cap pin is
    on two power nets, those nets are aliases of the same physical rail —
    the dual-label is a documentation convention (Apple's `PP_*` package /
    `VDD_*` die-side is the dominant case, but the signal is universal).

    Restricting the support evidence to capacitor pins is what makes this
    safe across schematic styles. IC pins on multiple nets ARE often valid
    aliases too (the SoC pin's name matches the die-side label and the trace
    carries a package-side label) but they're also more vulnerable to vision
    misreads of adjacent labels — caps give a topology-grounded signal:
    physical-cap-terminal isolation. Resistors and inductors are excluded
    too: each terminal is electrically distinct (resistor between two nets
    is the canonical case, not an alias).

    Implementation:
    - Build pin → set of rail labels (only labels in `rails` — ground/noise
      already filtered, both labels guaranteed `is_power=True`, no need to
      re-check).
    - Union-find on rail labels supported by capacitor pins on ≥ 2 of them.
    - Voltage coherence guard: if both sub-rails parse to incompatible
      voltages (Δ > 0.05V), skip the cluster (mismatch is more likely a
      vision OCR error than a real alias). When only one side parses, the
      other is treated as compatible.
    - Canonical preference per cluster (deterministic):
        1. has `source_refdes` (so source-attribution work isn't lost),
        2. higher `len(net.connects)` (richer underlying capture),
        3. alphabetically smallest label (tie-breaker).
    - Merge into canonical: union consumers + decoupling (preserve order,
      dedup); inherit `source_refdes` / `source_type` / `voltage_nominal`
      / `enable_net` from the first sub-rail with a non-null value
      (canonical wins ties because preference put it first). Drop the
      non-canonical entry from `rails`.
    - Return alias_map `{dropped_label: canonical_label}` so the caller can
      route decoupling-cap assignments (in `compile_electrical_graph`)
      through the canonical rail when a cap's `pin.net_label` is the
      dropped alias.

    Pure no-op when no cap pin spans ≥ 2 power rails (mnt-reform-style
    boards that don't dual-label rails). Empirically verified: zero merges
    on mnt-reform-motherboard, ~7 merges on iPhone X (covering the
    PP_CPU_PCORE/VDD_CPU, PP_GPU/VDD_GPU, PP_SOC_S1/VDD_SOC and similar
    SoC/PMIC dual-label families).

    Anti-collapse safety: typical merge count is 5-10% of total rails;
    well within I5's 30% floor.

    Runs LAST in the rail derivation chain so source-attribution work from
    earlier passes (`_recognize_buck_self_sense_outputs`,
    `_propagate_sources_through_rail_aliases`,
    `_augment_sources_from_external_connectors`) flows into the canonical
    rail when present on either sub-rail.

    """Promote die-side power pin names to NetNode aliases.

    SoC schematics double-label power nets: the SAME wire carries the
    package-side name (e.g. `PP1V1_S2`) on its trace and the die-side name
    (e.g. `VDD_BYPASS`) at the IC pin. The vision pass captures the
    package-side label as `pin.net_label` and the die-side label as
    `pin.name` — but only the former enters `graph.nets`. The die-side name
    is the canonical reference in datasheets and PMIC traces (« the
    VDD_BYPASS rail »); a diagnostic agent should be able to resolve it
    just like the package-side name.

    For each component pin where:
      - pin.role ∈ {power_in, power_out}, AND
      - pin.name matches the universal power-net pattern, AND
      - pin.name is not already a known net,
    add a NetNode aliasing the connected net (same connects + page set,
    is_power=True). Pure no-op when no such pins exist (mnt-reform-style
    boards that don't emit `pin.name` for power pins).

    The added entry is a real NetNode — `connects` is inherited from the
    underlying physical net so downstream consumers (UI, diagnostic agent)
    can walk it.

    Two materialization paths, attempted in order per pin:

    1. **Aliased path** (default, original behaviour). When
       `pin.net_label` resolves to an existing `graph.nets` entry, the new
       NetNode inherits its `connects` / `pages` / `is_global` — the
       die-side name and the package-side name share one physical wire.

    2. **Solitary die-side path** (additive). When `pin.name == pin.net_label`
       and that label is NOT in `graph.nets`, the merger has dropped the
       net because only one component pin in the captured schematic carries
       it (single-pin nets aren't materialized as NetNodes during
       `merge_pages`). On Apple SoC pin-list pages this is the dominant
       pattern for the analog auxiliary supplies (`VDD18_TSADC_*`,
       `VDD18_EFUSE*`, `VDD_FIXED_PLL_DDR<n>`) — each die-side rail enters
       the SoC on a single pin from a PMU on a separate (often un-captured)
       page. The label is real and the diagnostic agent / UI / eval should
       see it. Synthesize a minimal NetNode anchored on the only known pin;
       pages/is_global default conservatively because the underlying wire
       was never materialized.

    Ground-family names (VSS / AVSS / DVSS) are excluded by the regex.
    Power rails are NOT touched — `eg.power_rails` keeps its original keys
    so sourced/voltage invariants and rails counts are unchanged.
