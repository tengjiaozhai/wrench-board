# slot `.cache_schematic/{hash}/`. The root is SHARED across tenants on the same

# tenant B/PDF-B/hash hB) would race: if B's copy clobbers the root before A's
# background ingest reads it, `write_through_cache(hA)` snapshots B's graph into
# hA's slot → silent cross-tenant corruption. Mirrors `_RUNNING` in repairs.py

# need a shared lock). The INVARIANT this guarantees: `write_through_cache(H)`

    Managé (`owner_ref` set) — T9 per-owner, NO root clobber:
      Writes the per-owner pointer (_sources/{owner}/) mapping schematic_pdf →
      {filename, hash}; readers (Task 3) resolve owner→hash→.cache_schematic/
      {hash}/ directly. On a cache hit we do NOT restore to the root (that root
      copy is exactly what clobbered cross-tenant). On a miss we still ingest
      via the SAME background task — the root is mere build scratch in managed
      mode, snapshotted to the shared hash-cache by `write_through_cache`; the
      per-slug stampede guard serialises concurrent builds.

    Managed root = transient build scratch: the managed cache-miss path wipes the
    slug root via `clear_in_place_schematic` and uses it as scratch for the vision
    pipeline (serialised per slug by `_schedule_managed_ingest`). Self-host and
    managed tenants therefore MUST NOT coexist on the same slug — a deployment is
    managed-only or self-host-only (the root pin/derivatives belong to one model).
