"""Tests for the XZZ post-v6 diagnostic extractor.

The extractor pulls manufacturer-tagged resistance / voltage / signal
expectations out of the GB2312-marked sections that follow the
`v6v6555v6v6===` pattern in manufacturer-tagged XZZ dumps. The
in-tree engine recognises the markers but its
`_parse_resistance_section` expects a different line shape than what's
actually in the wild — see the module docstring for the layout.
