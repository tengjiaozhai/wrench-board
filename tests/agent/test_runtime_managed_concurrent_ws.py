"""Concurrent-WebSocket tests for the Managed Agents stream loop.

These tests exercise scenarios where two `_forward_session_to_ws` calls
overlap in time, on the same device or across tiers, and assert the
runtime's current behaviour around four axes flagged by an architectural
audit:

* dedup of `agent.custom_tool_use` ids when two forwarders share state
  (`events_by_id`) but each maintain a private `responded_tool_ids` set;
* cleanup when a WebSocket close fires while a custom tool dispatch is
  in flight — the stream task must drain through cancellation and not
  orphan its `session_mirrors` children;
* tier isolation when two forwarders run on different tiers
  (`fast` vs `deep`) for the same device with independent
  `SessionState` instances — no crosstalk on `message` / `turn_complete`
  frames;
* concurrent mutation of a shared `SessionState.highlights` set when
  two forwarders accidentally share the same session — documents the
  current last-write-wins / set-merge behaviour without prescribing a
  Lock that does not exist in production code.

Some assertions DOCUMENT a real bug (see `# CURRENT BEHAVIOR — see audit`
markers). Those tests pin the present behaviour so a future fix breaks
them and forces the fixer to update the assertion intentionally — they
do NOT prescribe the buggy behaviour as desirable.

The mocks mimic the SDK's `AsyncStream` and the WS so the suite stays
fast (sub-second) and offline. Setup helpers are intentionally local
copies of the ones in `test_runtime_managed_e2e.py` to keep each test
file self-contained — diverging shapes between concurrent and serial
tests would obscure the contract under test here.

    Setup mirrors what would happen if two WebSockets opened on the same
    `(device_slug, repair_id, conv_id)` and were wired into the same
    in-memory event index (a future "sticky session" pool). MA echoes
    the same `agent.custom_tool_use` event on both streams (it's the same

    The dispatcher runs **once per forwarder** because `responded_tool_ids`
    is created locally in each `_forward_session_to_ws` call (see
    `runtime_managed.py:2533`). The intended dedup contract — "MA must

    is broken under concurrent forwarders sharing a session: MA will
    receive two responses and reject the second with HTTP 400.

    The final set contains exactly ONE of the two refdes, not both. On
    a single asyncio thread with no awaits inside the synchronous
    `highlight_component` body, the runtime serializes the two calls and
    the second one wins. Documents the expectation that without a per-WS
