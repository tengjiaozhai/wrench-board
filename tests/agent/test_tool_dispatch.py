"""Unit tests for the dispatch table extracted from ``runtime_managed``.

The legacy ``_dispatch_tool`` waterfall lived inside ``runtime_managed.py``
and captured a closure over the WebSocket task locals — it was effectively
untestable without a full MA-session fixture. The dispatch refactor moved
the routing into ``tool_dispatch.py`` behind a ``ToolContext`` dataclass,
which makes the resolution surface trivially unit-testable.

Coverage focus: the routing rules (profile_* prefix, exact-name lookup,
bv_* fallback, unknown-tool error) — the per-tool handlers themselves are
already covered indirectly by the runtime_managed.* tests and the
tools.py / dispatch_bv.py suites.
